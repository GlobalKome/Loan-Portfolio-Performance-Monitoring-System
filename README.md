# Executive Summary

# User Story
Mrs. Adaobi Okonkwo, the Head of Retail Lending at ZenithCore Bank, is responsible for overseeing the performance of thousands of consumer loans issued by the bank. With limited visibility into how these loans are performing across customer types, states, and purposes, she needs an efficient way to track loan application trends, repayment patterns, and risk indicators in one place.

To solve this, she contracted me, a data analyst, to develop a Loan Portfolio Performance Monitoring System made up of three dashboards:
  A Summary Dashboard for executive insights,
  An Overview Dashboard to explore trends by segment,
  A Details Dashboard for operational-level tracking.

These tools will empower her team to shift from reactive reporting to proactive, insight-driven portfolio management—ultimately enabling smarter lending strategies and minimizing exposure to high-risk borrowers.
